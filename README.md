# Salesforce App-Owns-Data Embedding Sample

**SalesforceAppOwnsDataEmbedding** is a sample project which
demonstrates how to implement App-Owns-Data embedding with Power BI
reports. This project has been created using the [**Salesforce Developer
Experience
(SFDX)**](https://developer.salesforce.com/developer-centers/developer-experience/)
and the [**Salesforce
CLI**](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli). The goal of this
sample project is to provide guidance and demonstrate best practices to
developers who need to implement Power BI embedding in a Salesforce
environment.

App-Owns-Data embedding has a big advantage over User-Owns-Data
embedding when developing for Salesforce. More specifically,
App-Owns-Data embedding does not require each user to have an Azure AD
organizational account and a Power BI license. When developing with the
App-Owns-Data embedding model, your Salesforce users can remain unknown
to Power BI and your code has the flexibility to embed reports for any
users you want.

## Project Architecture

The architecture of this solution is built on top of an Apex class named
[**PowerBiEmbedManager**](https://github.com/PowerBiDevCamp/SalesforceAppOwnsDataEmbedding/blob/main/SalesforceAppOwnsDataEmbedding/force-app/main/default/classes/PowerBiEmbedManager.cls)
which is programmed to interact with both Azure AD and the [**Power BI
REST API**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-bi/) as
shown in the following diagram.

<img src="Images\ReadMe\media\image1.png" style="width:6.39662in;height:2.72727in" />

**PowerBiEmbedManager** implements [**Client Credentials
Flow**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow)
when it interacts with Azure AD to acquire an app-only access token.
App-only access tokens are important because they makes it possible to
call the Power BI REST API under the identity of a service principal
instead of calling under the identity of a user. Making calls to the
Power BI REST API as service principal is a best practice for developing
with App-Owns-Data embedding.

**PowerBiEmbedManager** must call the Power BI REST API for two
different reasons. First, it much acquire embedding data such as the
Embed Url associated with a specific report ID. Second,
**PowerBiEmbedManager** must call the Power BI REST API to generate
embed tokens which are required with App-Owns-Data embedding.

**PowerBiEmbedManager** has been designed as a controller class by
exposing a public **getEmbeddingDataForReport** method which has been
marked with the **AuraEnabled** annotation making it accessible to
Lighting Aura components and to Lightning web components. A client-side
component can call **getEmbeddingDataForReport** to retrieve the
embedding data and the embed token for a specific report.

The **SalesforceAppOwnsDataEmbedding** project contains a Lighting Aura
component named
[**powerBiReportAura**](https://github.com/PowerBiDevCamp/SalesforceAppOwnsDataEmbedding/tree/main/SalesforceAppOwnsDataEmbedding/force-app/main/default/aura/powerBiReportAura).
When you add an instance of the **powerBiReportAura** component to a
Lightning application page, you must configure it with the **Workspace
ID** and the **Report ID** for a specific report in a Power BI
workspace. This design makes it possible to add multiple instances of
the **powerBiReportAura** component and configure each instance to embed
a different Power BI report.

<img src="Images\ReadMe\media\image2.png" style="width:6.24324in;height:1.53896in" />

Once you have configured a **powerBiReportAura** component instance with
a **Workspace ID** and **Report ID**, these two configuration values
will be passed as parameters when the component calls
**getEmbeddingDataForReport**. The **PowerBiEmbedManager** class
responds to this remote function call by returning the embed URL and the
embed token which will be used to embed a report in the browser.

<img src="Images\ReadMe\media\image3.png" style="width:7.5in;height:1.88333in" />

Once the **powerBiReportAura** component has successfully called
**getEmbeddingDataForReport**, it has acquired the embedding data and
the embed token it needs to embed a report on the hosting web page. In a
final step, the **powerBiReportAura** component executes JavaScript code
in the browser and uses the [**Power BI JavaScript
API**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/overview/powerbi/overview)
to implement the report embedding process.

<img src="Images\ReadMe\media\image4.png" style="width:6.07369in;height:1.58442in" />

When a Power BI report is embedded on a Web page such as a Lightning
application page, it establishes a direct connection back to the Power
BI Service. Once the report has loaded, the user can begin to interact
with the report by setting filters and navigating between pages. As
users interact with the report, these interactions are handled by direct
communications between the report and the Power BI Service.

## Setting Up the Test Environment

In order to set up and test this sample project, you'll need a Power BI
report in a Microsoft 365 tenant in which you can create a new Azure AD
application. If you need to create a free trial Microsoft 365
environment for testing with Azure AD and Power BI, you can do so using
this [Microsoft 365 trial sign-up
page](https://github.com/PowerBiDevCamp/Camp-Sessions/raw/master/Create%20Power%20BI%20Development%20Environment.pdf).
You'll also need a Salesforce development environment. If you don't
already have a Salesforce development environment, you can sign up for
one for free using the [Salesforce lightning platform signup
page](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup).

Once you have a Salesforce organization for testing, you will need to
complete the following setup tasks to configure the environment for the
**SalesforceAppOwnsDataEmbedding** project.

-   Add remote site settings for Azure AD and Power BI REST API

-   Create an Azure AD application to call the Power BI REST API

-   Create a custom metadata type to store client credentials for the
    Azure AD application

-   Create a static resource by uploading a copy of the Power BI
    JavaScript API (powerbi.js)

### Add Remote Site Settings

Start by navigating to the Salesforce organization **Setup page** and
searching for the **Remote Site Settings** page. Use the Remote Site
Setting to add remote site settings for
**https://login.microsoftonline.com** and **https://api.powerbi.com**.
Once again, these configuration settings are required so that code in
the Apex class can execute HTTP requests to Azure AD and the Power BI
REST API.

<img src="Images\ReadMe\media\image6.png" style="width:3.42857in;height:1.12457in" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description automatically generated" />

### Create the Azure AD Application

After adding the remote site settings, the next step is to create and
configure a new Azure AD application to support calling the Power BI
REST API as a service principal. You can create the required Azure AD
application by following the steps in [**Create an Azure AD Application
for App-Owns-Data
Embedding**](https://github.com/PowerBiDevCamp/SalesforceAppOwnsDataEmbedding/blob/main/Create%20an%20Azure%20AD%20Application%20for%20App-Owns-Data%20Embedding.md).

Once you have completed the steps to create and configure the new Azure
AD application, you should have a **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and
**Tenant ID** that you will need in the next step when you create a
Create custom metadata type to store the client credentials.

<img src="Images\ReadMe\media\image7.png" style="width:3.69987in;height:2.20859in" />

### Create the Custom Metadata Type

The next step is to create a Create Custom Metadata Type that will be
used to track the client credentials *(i.e. Client ID and Client
Secret)* required to authenticate with Azure AD as a service principal.
Start by navigating to the Salesforce organization **Setup page** and
searching for the **Custom Metadata Types** page. Click the **New Custom
Metadata Type** button.

<img src="Images\ReadMe\media\image8.png" style="width:5.43333in;height:2.39067in" />

In the **New Custom Metadata Type** dialog, enter the following values.

-   **Label** = **Power BI Auth Setting**

-   **Plural Label** = **Power BI Auth Settings**

-   **Object Name** = **Power\_BI\_Auth\_Setting**

<img src="Images\ReadMe\media\image9.png" style="width:3.97626in;height:1.625in" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description automatically generated" />

Below in the **New Custom Metadata Type** dialog there is a
**Visibility** setting. Leave the **Visibility** setting at it's default
value of **All Apex code and APIs can use the type and itâ€™s visible in
Setup**. This is the setting you want when testing a POC application or
working in a development environment. However, it's common to change
this setting for a custom metadata type in a production environment to
store sensitive data like a Client Secret in a more secure and encrypted
fashion. Click the **Save** button to create the new custom metadata
type.

<img src="Images\ReadMe\media\image10.png" style="width:6.7in;height:1.04222in" />

A very valuable aspect of creating a custom metadata type is that it
becomes an actual type for the Apex programming language. You can
determine what the type name will be by looking at the **API Name**
property which is **Power\_BI\_Auth\_Setting\_\_mdt** for the new type
you've just been created. You can see that the **API Name** is created
by taking the **Object Name** you provided and appending **\_\_mdt** at
the end.

<img src="Images\ReadMe\media\image11.png" style="width:4.33333in;height:2.33333in" />

After you have initially created the new custom metadata type, you must
add custom fields for the Azure AD application's Client ID, Client
Secret the Tenant ID. Click the **New** button in the **Custom Fields**
section to begin adding fields.

<img src="Images\ReadMe\media\image12.png" style="width:6.01719in;height:1.11043in" />

Create the following three new custom fields.

-   Create a new **Text** field named **ClientId** with unique values
    and a max of 36 characters

-   Create a new **Text** field named **ClientSecret** with max of 255
    characters

-   Create a new **Text** field named **TenantId** with max of 36
    characters

<img src="Images\ReadMe\media\image13.png" style="width:6.00029in;height:1.34356in" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated" />

Note that these custom fields will be added as public fields to the
custom metadata type named **Power\_BI\_Auth\_Setting\_\_mdt**. The
**API Name** values created for these fields will be **ClientId\_\_c**,
**ClientSecret\_\_c** and **TenantId\_\_c**.

You should take note that there is code in the Apex class named
**[PowerBiEmbedManager](https://github.com/PowerBiDevCamp/SalesforceAppOwnsDataEmbedding/blob/main/SalesforceAppOwnsDataEmbedding/force-app/main/default/classes/PowerBiEmbedManager.cls)**
which uses the **API Name** of this custom metadata type and it custom
fields to retrieve a Client ID, Client Secret and Tenant ID values when
using client credentials flow.

At this point you have created the custom metadata type. Next, you are
going to create a new record using the custom metadata type to track a
set of client credentials for testing.

Return back to the **Custom Metadata Types** page. You should see a new
entry for the new custom metadata type with a Label value of
**Power\_BI\_AUTH\_SETTING**. Click on the **Manage Records** button to
create a new record.

<img src="Images\ReadMe\media\image14.png" style="width:4.81667in;height:1.86489in" />

You should now see an entry form where you can enter values for the
**ClientId**, **ClientSecret** and **TenantId**. Enter a value of
**PowerBiApp** for both the **Label** and the **Power BI Auth Setting
Name**. Enter the values you collected earlier for the **ClientId**,
**ClientSecret** and **TenantId**. When you are done, click **Save** to
create the new record with the client credentials.

<img src="Images\ReadMe\media\image15.png" style="width:4.81667in;height:2.34654in" />

When you return back to the **Power BI Auth Settings** page, you can see
that the new record has a **Power BI Auth Settings Name** of
**PowerBiApp**. You will need this value in the Apex code that needs to
retrieve these field values from this record.

<img src="Images\ReadMe\media\image16.png" style="width:4.11048in;height:1.27273in" alt="Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated" />

Now that you have create a custom metadata type and an associated record
to store client credentials, you should understand the benefits. It's
very easy to access the record of a custom metadata type when
programming in Apex. You can now write the following Apex code to
retrieve the client credentials when they are needed for authentication.

// get auth settings from custom metadata type record

Power\_BI\_Auth\_Setting\_\_mdt authSetting =
Power\_BI\_Auth\_Setting\_\_mdt.getInstance('PowerBiApp');

string TenantId = authSetting.TenantId\_\_c;

string ClientId = authSetting.ClientId\_\_c;

string ClientSecret = authSetting.ClientSecret\_\_c;

Now there is just one more task remaining in the set up process. This is
you must upload the source file for the Power BI JavaScript API
(powerbi.js) into your Salesforce organization as a static resource.

### Upload powerbi.js as a Static Resource

First, you must download a local copy of **powerbi.js** which is the
main JavaScript source file for the Power BI JavaScript API. This can be
done using [this
ink](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/PowerBI-JavaScript/master/dist/powerbi.js).
Once you have downloaded a local copy, you can then upload it to your
Salesforce organization as a static resource.

Start by navigating to the Salesforce organization **Setup page** and
searching for the **Static Resources** page. While it's easy to miss,
there is a **New** button on this page. Click the **New** button to
create a new static resource.

<img src="Images\ReadMe\media\image17.png" style="width:4.07083in;height:1.55732in" />

Give the new static resource a **Name** of **powerbijs**. Upload the
source file named **powerbi.js** by clicking the **Choose File** button
and then locating the file in the **File Open** dialog. Set the **Cache
Control** to **Public** to enable sharing and faster load times for this
JavaScript library file in the browser. When you have entered all the
data, click **Save** to upload **powerbi.js** and make it available as a
new static resource named **powerbijs**.

<img src="Images\ReadMe\media\image18.png" style="width:5.85088in;height:1.85664in" />

When you return to the **Static Resources** page, you should be able to
verify that the static resource has been created and that it's name is
**powerbijs**. This name will be important because it must be used by
any Lightning component that needs to load this library.

<img src="Images\ReadMe\media\image19.png" style="width:4.07143in;height:1.37871in" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description automatically generated" />
